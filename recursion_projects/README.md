This is an assignment on recursions
the tasks were
1. to define a fibanocci method #fib(n) using loops that takes a number n and returns an array containg the fibanocci sequence
2. was the same as the task above to define a fibanocci method #fib_rec(n) but this time we had to used recursions instead of loops
3. the task was to define a method #merge_sort(array) that performs a merge sort recursively on an array

the merge sort task was a bit challenging to understand but after some youtube videos and a bit of googling i managed to acomplish the task
